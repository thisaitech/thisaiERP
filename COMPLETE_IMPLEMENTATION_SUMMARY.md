## 💡 ABOUT THE OpenAI API ERROR

### Why You Got the Error:
Your OpenAI account doesn't have access to `gpt-4o-mini` model. This usually means:
1. Account needs billing enabled
2. Or account is on free tier

### What I Fixed:
Changed model from `gpt-4o-mini` to `gpt-4-turbo`

### Next Steps for AI Scanner:
**Option 1:** Enable billing on OpenAI account (recommended)
- Go to: https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing
- Add payment method
- Add $5-10 credit
- Will work with both `gpt-4-turbo` and `gpt-4o-mini`

**Option 2:** Use Google Vision API instead
1. Uncomment Google Vision API key in `.env`
2. Change `provider: 'google'` in `enhancedReceiptAI.ts` line 10
3. Less accurate but free (1000 scans/month)

**Recommendation:** Option 1 (OpenAI) gives much better accuracy for complex invoices.

## 💻 HOW TO USE

### Viewing Party Ledgers:
1. Go to **Parties** page (http://localhost:3002/parties)
2. Click on any party in the list
3. Click **"View Ledger"** button
4. Ledger modal opens showing:
   - All invoices (debit entries)
   - All payments (credit entries)
   - Running balance after each transaction
   - Total debit, credit, and final balance

### Understanding Ledger Balances:
- **Positive Balance (Blue):** Customer owes you money (receivable)
- **Negative Balance (Red):** You owe supplier money (payable)
- **Zero Balance:** All settled

### Creating Transactions:
- **Sales Invoice:** Creates debit entry (increases receivable)
- **Purchase Invoice:** Creates credit entry (increases payable)
- **Payment Received:** Creates credit entry (decreases receivable)
- **Payment Made:** Creates debit entry (decreases payable)

---

## 🔍 BROWSER CONSOLE DEBUGGING

### View All Ledger Entries:
```javascript
// Open browser console (F12)
const entries = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('thisai_crm_ledger_entries') || '[]')
console.table(entries)
```

### View Ledger for Specific Party:
```javascript
const partyId = 'your_party_id_here'
const partyEntries = entries.filter(e => e.partyId === partyId)
console.table(partyEntries)
```

### Check Current Balance:
```javascript
const balance = partyEntries[partyEntries.length - 1]?.balance || 0
console.log('Current Balance:', balance)
```

## 🎓 TECHNICAL DETAILS

### Ledger Service Architecture:
```
ledgerService.ts
├── createInvoiceLedgerEntry()    // Called when invoice created
├── createPaymentLedgerEntry()    // Called when payment recorded
├── getPartyLedger()               // Fetch all entries for party
├── getPartyBalance()              // Get current balance
├── getLedgerSummary()             // Get total receivables/payables
└── LocalStorage fallback          // Works offline
```

### Data Flow:
```
Invoice Created
    ↓
invoiceService.updateStockForInvoice()
    ↓
ledgerService.createInvoiceLedgerEntry()
    ↓
Calculate running balance
    ↓
Save to Firebase/LocalStorage
    ↓
Parties page auto-loads when modal opened
```

### Balance Calculation Logic:
```typescript
newBalance = previousBalance + debit - credit

// For SALES:
// - Invoice: debit = amount, credit = 0
// - Payment: debit = 0, credit = amount

// For PURCHASES:
// - Invoice: debit = 0, credit = amount
// - Payment: debit = amount, credit = 0
```
